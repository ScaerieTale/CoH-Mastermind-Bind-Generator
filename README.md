# Welcome to ScaerieTale's Mastermind Numpad Bind Generator Projectâ„¢!

That name is a bit of a mouthful.  I'll work on that.  Anyway, what IS the STMMBGP?  Simply put it's an effort by me, ScaerieTale, to create a script that can automatically generate all the files needed to use the legendary Sandolphan's [Mastermind Numpad Binds](https://web.archive.org/web/20120904222729/http://boards.cityofheroes.com/showthread.php?t=117256 "Mastermind Numpad Binds") as painlessly as possible.

Eventually I want it to create the 'master' MM.txt file as well as generating the Minion, Lieutenant, and Boss level pets' respective files, so all the end user has to do is log into City of Heroes/Villains/Rogue, and type a single slash command (after downloading / creating the files of course!)

## City of Heroes?  WTF?
If you're not familiar with the game, City of Heroes was the original Superpowered MMORPG.  It first released in 2004 and was shut down in 2012.  [Here's the Wikipedia article.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Heroes "Here's the Wikipedia article.")

And yes, if you haven't heard, the game is back in Rogue server form.  Thare are several community-led efforts to continue the game, resulting in multiple shard types.

I recommend the [City of Heroes Reddit](https://wold.reddit.com/r/CityofHeroes/ "City of Heroes Reddit") for more information as well as server lists and how you can download and play the game.  I won't be providing any information  to that end here because it's well outside my project's purview, and above my pay grade ;)

## What makes these numpad binds worth the trouble?
It's a simple and elegant solution to what can otherwise feel like complete chaos.  In the heat of a battle against an ArchVillain or Giant Monster, the last thing you want is to be scrambling for your pets' Defensive Mode button when you really need it.

The default system is, to be honest, a joke.  You either have to click buttons, or hunt across your hotbars, sometimes both.  It's unintuitive selecting specific pets for specific commands and just makes the Archetype not fun.

But with Sandolphan's Numpad keybind system, everything is laid out right where, and when, you need it.  Need to take a big hit? Numpad 0 Numpad 5.  This puts all your pets into Defensive mode, instantly enabling Bodyguard, the mechanic by which damage to you gets split up amongst your pets.

Want your Arsonist to get his butt back in line before he's roasted?  Slap 1, 8 to put your Tier 1 thugs into Follow mode, then slide your finger left and tap 7 to put them back on the offensive.  Or you can set up a custom bind specifically targetting the Arsonist as Sandolphan's guide discusses.

Currently I only have the pets script finished, saved here on main.  Soon I hope to have the full script and possibly an EXE ready, just in case one of these aforementioned community development teams decide to add a new Mastermind primary.  

Hey, an evil genius can dream, right?
